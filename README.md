# QR-Code-generator-using-Python-and-Tkinter

Nowadays we all use QR code for multiple purposes like making payments, sharing WiFi, etc. Have you ever wished to generate such QR code on your own? We are here with a project for QR code generator using Python. So, follow us to build this Python project.

About QR Code Generator Project
QR Code is a machine-readable matrix barcode that uniquely represents information. With the increase in optical capabilities of smartphones, the use of QR codes started increasing.

In this project, we will build a QR Code generator using Python Modules.

Generate QR Code in Python
We will be using Tkinter and Qrcode modules in Python to build this project. We use the Tkinter module to build the GUI to take the following inputs:

text/URL to convert to QR Code
location to save the QR code with name
size of the QR code.
Then we generate the QR code from the above inputs and save in the given location using the qrcode module.

Project Prerequisites
It is suggested that the developer has prior knowledge on Python and the Tkinter module. Also, use the below commands to install the qrcode and tkinter modules.

pip install qrcode
Steps to build the QR Code Generator in Python
To build the QR code generator project using Python we need to follow the below steps:
1. Importing the modules
2. Creating the main window
3. Taking the input of the text/URL, location to store the QR code, name of the QR code and the size of the QR code
4. Writing the function to generate and save the QR Code

Summary
Hurray! We have successfully built the QR Code generator in Python. In this, we learned the basic widgets of the tkinter module and to generate the QR Code using the qrcode module. Hope you enjoyed building this project.
